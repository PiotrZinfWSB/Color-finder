# Color-finder

Testing whether a neural network can support the formulation of powder coating recipes.

## Project Description
This project was an experiment to develop and train a neural network capable of predicting pigment types and quantities required to reproduce a given color, represented as coordinates in the CIELAB color space.  

Although the model was not successful due to limited training data and a wide range of features, the project provided valuable insights into:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection challenges
- Limitations of small datasets in machine learning
- Practical applications of TensorFlow in experimental projects

## Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- NumPy / Pandas  

## Status
Prototype â€“ learning project, not fully functional
